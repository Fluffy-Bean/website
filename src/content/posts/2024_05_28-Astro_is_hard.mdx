Hello! Welcome to my new website, or at least as of writing this blog.
It's been written from scratch with Astro, Typescript and a lot of suffering, mostly due to bugs and random annoyances...

So where do I start, maybe _why_ I have chosen Astro over other existing options.

## Why Astro

TLDR: I don't know :3

-   I've been trying to learn typescript through trying astro
-   Astro is hard, due to all the issues I've encountered

## The problems

-   Issue with Astros `getEntries()` not working, thus having to implement my own method
-   Fighting with Astro to display banner images, it won
-   Using external plugins for images/slides
    -   Specifically passing variables into scripts

```typescript
export async function getTagsBySlug(
    postTags: string[],
): Promise<CollectionEntry<"tags">[]> {
    // Collect all the tags from collections
    const allTags: CollectionEntry<"tags">[] = await getCollection("tags");

    // Loop through all the tags in a post and the tags in the collections
    // To see if they match, if they do we'll return them
    const tags: CollectionEntry<"tags">[] = [];
    postTags.forEach((postTag) => {
        allTags.forEach((allTag) => {
            if (allTag.slug === postTag) tags.push(allTag);
        });
    });

    // Yeet
    return tags;
}
```

## What I've learned

-   More experience writing in Typescript
-   Learning about MDX accidentally
-   Reading Documentation, ironically
