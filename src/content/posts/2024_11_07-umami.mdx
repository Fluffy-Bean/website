## Why I went with umami

Sike, before we talk about umami, lets talk about some of the other options I had, that I didn't go with

### Matomo

I've seen Matomo get suggested in a few places before I went with Plausible originally, but I never checked it out till
now. While it looked solid, it also has _too_ much stuff... I didn't need or want a heatmap of interactions throughout
my website, nor session recording, or any ecommerce stuff.

Even with all that, I didn't particularly like the design, it was cluttered and confusing to go through the demo site.

### PostHog

PostHog was the second thing I've checked out, while it looked promising, it was just too much along with not solving my
problem of _having_ to use docker.

The requirements were also a bit insane for my needs, 8GBs of ram (recommended minimum) in comparison to the 256MB the
CT running umami currently has.

### Fathom

This was the last one I checked out before going with umami, I liked the design as it was similar to Plausible, and had
the feature set that I was looking for, with no complicated dashboards.

Buuuuuut, there is no self-hostable option, [kinda](https://github.com/usefathom/fathom). The lite version is no longer
maintained. Which is a shame, as it fathom looked promising and Go is a nice language to work with...

Maybe I could pick it up in the future, and bring it back to life again

## Services feature comparison

Blank sections are due to me not being able to find information on said topic, also, features listed are things I
specifically looked for.

|                               | Matomo | PostHog | umami           | Fathom   | Plausible |
| ----------------------------- | ------ | ------- | --------------- | -------- | --------- |
| Self-Hostable                 | Yes    | Yes     | Yes             | Yes [^1] | Yes       |
| Hosting method                | PHP    | Docker  | Node or Docker  | Go [^2]  | Docker    |
| GDPR compliant                | Yes    | Yes     | Yes             | Yes [^3] | Yes       |
| Email reports                 | Yes    | Yes     |                 |          | Yes       |
| Tracking events               | Yes    | Yes     | Yes [^4]        |          | No        |
| Simple (and pretty) dashboard | No     | Mostly  | Yes             | Yes      | Yes       |
| Minimum RAM                   | 1GB    | 8GB     | 512MB [^5]      |          | 1GB       |
| Supported Databases           | MySQL  |         | Postgres, MySQL | SQLite   |           |

[^1]: An old and limited version is available, that is no longer maintained
[^2]: The self-hosted (lite) version uses Go, the paid version uses [Laravel](https://github.com/usefathom/fathom/issues/336#issuecomment-1079549690).
[^3]: Fathom is a Canadian based company, and while their servers are also in Canada, [they comply with EU regulations and laws](https://usefathom.com/features/eu-isolation).
[^4]: unami doesn't track events automatically [and needs to be setup manually across the website](https://umami.is/docs/track-events).
[^5]: unami doesn't list minimum requirements, so far from my testing, this is about what I needed for all my websites. For installs that have higher page visit counts, I imagine more would be needed.

<Note text="This ain't a scientific featurelist" />

## So what was wrong with Plausible?

Simply put, too heavy for my use-case. It was designed for websites that see thousands of people per week, maybe even a
day, but I haven't even reached a thousand views in a year! Secondly, docker, it has it's uses, but since all my
services already run in LXT/Proxmox containers, no point of putting them within another container.

All that I could've lived with fine, if not for trying to upgrade it. It broke, even in a docker container, it refused
to start after an update and wouldn't show any signs of life other that pushing my CPU usage to 100%, then freezing the
container!

Downgrading - worked. But since database migrations have been complete, a lot of the pages no longer worked, so I just
left it alone, until I was bothered with finding an alternative solution.

## umami

Finally, something I was looking for, it has all the features I need, with not too much extra stuff I'll never use. AND
it's self-hostable with a non-docker option!

Though, I did run into some issues compiling the project, specifically needing 2GBs of ram, lol

And here's a dashboard comparison, before umami and Plausible

## Now onto the fun stuff

Here's the steps I've taken to setup umami, it's not meant as a tutorial, but hopefully will be helpful regardless...

### Alpine

For this, I went with Alpine! It was my first time trying it, but it went great, and will probably be moving all my
services to it at some point, but that should be its own blog post. Main hurdle I had was understanding `OpenRC`, as
Alpine doesn't use `systemd`, but once I gotten used to `rc-update add <service>` and
`rc-service <service> start/stop/status` it went very smoothly.

Obviously firstly we should update all the available packages and install some useful tools

```bash
apk update
apk upgrade
apk add vim git
```

### Caddy

<Note text="3000 is the default port for yarn, but adjust for your needs" />

I didn't reaaaaaly need caddy for this, as it would mean the service would be behind two proxies, but I wanted to setup
caddy anyway. It was quite simple really

```bash
apk add caddy
rc-update add caddy
# Reboot
rc-service caddy start
# And make the required dirs and files
mkdir /var/www/html
```

Then, in `/etc/caddy`, we edit the `Caddyfile`

```bash
cd /etc/caddy
vim Caddyfile
```

And add the following

```caddyfile
:8080 {
  reverse_proxy localhost:3000
}
```

And finally

```bash
# While still in /etc/caddy
caddy reload
```

### Postgres

It was slightly more manual than it is usually on ubuntu, but this is a great guide that still is relative
https://luppeng.wordpress.com/2020/02/28/install-and-start-postgresql-on-alpine-linux/

Then I just needed to make a database with a simple command.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE umami;
```

### Installing umami

The [official documentation](https://umami.is/docs/install) is the nicest, but there is some extra stuff you need todo
outside-of their tutorial

Firstly we make the required directory and clone the project

```bash
mkdir /var/www/html
```

<Note text="Before you go any further, follow the official documentation, then come back :3" />

### Setting up umami as a service

While umami has a section on turning the project into a service, I prefer using what's already on the system for this,
OpenRC!

Making a service on OpenRC is actually quite simple,
[they have a guide for making services too](https://github.com/OpenRC/openrc/blob/master/service-script-guide.md).

First, make a user for the service, such as `umami`. Then run the following command to make, and edit, a file for the
service

```bash
touch /etc/init.d/umami
vim /etc/init.d/umami
```

And enter the following

```bash
#!/sbin/openrc-run

YARN_USER="umami"
PROJECT_DIR="/var/www/html/umami"
YARN_CMD="/usr/local/bin/yarn start"
APP_NAME="umami"

command="$YARN_CMD"
command_args="start"
command_user="$YARN_USER"
pidfile="/var/run/${APP_NAME}.pid"
output_log="/var/log/${APP_NAME}.log"
error_log="/var/log/${APP_NAME}_error.log"

depend() {
    need net
}

start() {
    ebegin "Starting ${APP_NAME}"

    start-stop-daemon --start --user "$YARN_USER" \
                      --make-pidfile --pidfile "$pidfile" \
                      --chdir "$PROJECT_DIR" \
                      --exec "$command" -- $command_args >> "$output_log" 2>> "$error_log" &

    eend $?
}

stop() {
    ebegin "Stopping ${APP_NAME}"

    start-stop-daemon --stop --pidfile "$pidfile"

    eend $?
}
```

and run the following - same - commands as we did earlier for caddy

```bash
rc-update add umami
# Reboot
rc-service umami start
```

And we're done! You may also now notice new text on the bottom of the page

If you really don't like the idea of your visit being counted, run

```js
localStorage.setItem("umami.disabled", 1);
```

In the browser console to remove all future visit counts.
